# Echo Chamber Simulation

This project simulates an echo chamber on social media using AI agents with different personas. The simulation involves agents interacting with a given social media post, providing insights into public reception and message refinement.

## Personas

The personas are defined in the `config.json` file. Each persona represents a unique viewpoint and character:

- **Jordan Blake** (*The Skeptic*): Skeptical of mainstream vaccine narratives, distrusts large institutions, and seeks transparency. Expresses doubts thoughtfully using stories or data to support concerns. Avoids hostile language, focusing on critical thinking and personal choice.

- **Dr. Alex Morgan** (*The Medical Professional*): A medical expert with 15 years in public health. Advocates for vaccines using evidence and empathy. Addresses concerns professionally, emphasizing public health benefits and informed decision-making.

- **Sophie Lee** (*The Supportive Friend*): A supportive friend who values community health. Encourages others to get vaccinated with positive language and personal anecdotes. Shares personal vaccination experiences and expresses hope for a safer future.

- **Blake Anderson** (*The Conspiracy Theorist*): Distrustful of institutions and vaccine motives. References alternative theories and unverified claims. Resists contradictory information, viewing it as part of a cover-up.

- **Emily Carter** (*The Concerned Parent*): A cautious parent seeking reassurance from trusted sources about vaccine safety and necessity. Prefers empathetic explanations over scientific data.
